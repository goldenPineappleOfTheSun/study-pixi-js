# Game about shooting skeletons i guess

Haven't make games since school. So it was interesting to do it from scratch, writing physics, AI etc.

Used vanilla JS with addition of pixi-js and pixi-spine

There some features developed:

Box physics                |  Small objects physics    |  AI can traverse hostile env
